<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>This is a simple demo for sending midi data to Edison that controls the actuators</p>
<p>Make sure that this web server is run on edison and that you have your MIDI interface ready - and then play some notes. If everything works - you should see LEDs connected to pins 6-12 on your Edison light up according to the note being played.</p>
